Scientific Calculator

    This calculator supports basic calculations such as basic, floating point, trigonometric functions, exponents, etc.,
and supports functions such as function editing, operations with (), and legality checking of algorithms. The last operation
result can be saved when the app exits, and the last operation result can be displayed when the app re-enters. In order to
meet the needs of different users for calculation accuracy, this program can set the calculation accuracy.

1. Basic Operation
   This program supports basic four arithmetic operations, including '‘+'’, '‘-'’, '‘×'’, '‘÷'’ and other operations.
2. Floating point operation
   This program supports floating-point operations and can get decimals of the specified number of digits according to the
set precision.
3. Trigonometric and logarithmic operations
   This program not only supports the calculation of trigonometric functions such as "sin", "cos", "tan", but also supports
the calculation of logarithmic functions such as "log" and "ln". In order to facilitate the calculation, when using these
functions, this program will automatically add "(", in this case, the user needs to add according to the operation rules ")".
4. Exponential and reciprocal operations
This program supports related index operations such as "x^y" and supports "1/x" reciprocal operations.
5. Use brackets
This program supports the use of "()", and "[]" and "{}" are not supported at this time.
6. Setting accuracy
This program supports the precision setting. The user can click the “prec” button, select the relevant precision in the pop-up box,
and then click “yes” to confirm the selected precision.
7. Save last operation result
This program can save the results of the last program operation, save the user calculation results when the user exits the program,
and can redisplay the last operation result when the user restarts the program.
8. Equation editing and equation legality check
The user can modify and delete the other program during the calculation process. When the user clicks "=", the program will check
the legality of the other program to avoid calculation errors.
